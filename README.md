# 🎵 Project: CloBeats (PROTOTYPE)

**CloBeats** is a modern, customizable, and brand-new Guitar Hero clone game built from the ground-up for simplicity, and user friendliness.

## 🚀 Features
- **Custom Online Downloads** – Download community-curated songs, venue decor, and 3D models.
- **Rapid Sustains** – When sustains show up as squiggly lines, strum as fast as you can! (until they end, of course)
- **Animated Venue** – Source code includes camera animation editor that saves to a JSON file. (other animation types coming soon!)
- **Fast Rendering** – Powered by Unity 6.3 for high performance.
- **Pitch-Bended Sustains** – When pitch-bended sustains show up, slowly press the whammy bar on the pitch to get more points. (it takes practice to get it right the first time!)
- **and more coming soon!**

## 📦 Installation

When the game launches for the first time, you must set the songs folder in Options.
Then you must either restart the game, or click on `Regen List` in Quickplay menu and it will automatically regenerate the songs list.

## 📚 Documentation
Please see the Wiki (WIP) for detailed documentation on curating for the game, making custom 3D models, and animating venues.
